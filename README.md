# CS 330 Computational Graphics and Visualization Project

## ðŸ“¦ Project Files
This repository contains two main components:

- `3D_Scene.zip`: A complete archive of my 3D scene project built in OpenGL.
- `Design_Decisions.docx`: A detailed write-up of my design choices, lighting setup, and object/material decisions during the development process.

### How do I approach designing software?
I approach software design by first understanding the problem, then breaking it into smaller components that can be implemented step-by-step. For this project, I focused on how I wanted the final scene to look and feel, and I mapped each visual element (objects, lighting, materials) to the code that would make it happen.

### What new design skills has your work on the project helped you to craft?
I developed a better understanding of visual hierarchy, camera angles, and how material and lighting choices work together to shape user perception in a 3D scene. I also got more confident designing realistic object layouts using ambient, diffuse, and specular lighting models.

### What design process did you follow for your project work?
I followed an iterative process: build something small, test it, tweak it, and repeat. I started with the floor, then added a laptop, a small dish, a red cylinder, and more. After each new element, I adjusted lighting and placement to make everything work together.

### How could tactics from your design approach be applied in future work?
This approach applies to UI design, game development, or any project where visual clarity matters. Planning out interactions and refining them gradually works well in both technical and creative settings.

### How do I approach developing programs?
I like to get a basic version working quickly, then slowly add features. I debug as I go and frequently test changes. For the 3D scene, I built and rendered each object one at a time so I could see exactly what changed and avoid breaking previous work.

### What new development strategies did you use while working on your 3D scene?
I used a shader-based lighting system for the first time, applying realistic materials using ambient, diffuse, and specular terms. I also experimented with normal maps and UV scaling to enhance the look of the textures.

### How did iteration factor into your development?
Iteration was key. I tried different angles for the lights, adjusted shininess and reflectivity on materials, and tuned how shadows and highlights behaved. Every visual issue taught me something I could fix in the next version.

### How has your approach to developing code evolved throughout the milestones?
At first, I focused only on getting the scene to load. But as I progressed, I started thinking more about user experience, realism, and performance. I also cleaned up my functions and comments to keep the code more maintainable.

### How can computer science help me in reaching my goals?
Computer science gives me the power to turn ideas into interactive systems. Whether Iâ€™m building dashboards, simulations, or game environments, the logic and structure Iâ€™ve learned from this course carry over into everything I do.

### How do computational graphics and visualizations give you new knowledge and skills that can be applied in your future educational pathway?
These skills help with data visualization, virtual environments, and simulations. If I pursue advanced courses or projects in AI or security, being able to represent information visually is a huge plus.

### How do computational graphics and visualizations give you new knowledge and skills that can be applied in your future professional pathway?
In the professional world, these skills can be used in UI/UX work, game design, AR/VR development, or security tools that visualize complex data. I now understand how lighting, texture, and layout can make a digital environment feel more real and intuitive.
